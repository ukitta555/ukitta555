### Hi there!

My name is Vlad. Here you will mostly see repositories with the solutions to online courses that I did and my uni assignments. I also have some spaghetti code I wrote for my personal projects that you can find here...

Anyhow, I hope you find the code that I wrote useful for your projects.
