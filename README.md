### Hi there!

My name is Vlad. Here you will mostly see repositories with the solutions to online courses that I did and my uni assignments. Someday I won't be ashamed of the spaghetti code I wrote in personal projects, and will put them out as well...

Anyhow, I hope you find the code that I wrote useful for your projects.
